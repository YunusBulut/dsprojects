You also have information on marketing spend on a weekly level."

    "\n",
    "If the email/password signups have NOT declined, but plan choices and/or payments have, then I would take a mean of the weeks before and after the decline and make sure that the difference between them is statistically significant using a p-test. If so, that should be the starting point for deeper investigation.\n",
