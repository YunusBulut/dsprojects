# For each of these scenarios decide if you could use supervised or unsupervised techniques, or both!

- **Define the likelihood that an individual will contract a specific disease**    
    - This is probably a supervised learning model, given that knowledge about a disease is specific and trainable. You *could* try to create 2 clusters in an unsupervised model, but the likelihood of a model finding the right 2 clusters is probably low.
- **Translate a set of images into variables for modeling**    
    - Unsupervised learning is the best way to extract features from pixels, which is prohibitively time consuming and difficult to do manually (i.e. to create training data).
- **An ecommerce company wants to identify power users**    
    - Given the specific and measureable nature of this target outcome, this is a supervised learning problem, especially assuming they have a trove of user data to begin with.
- **That same company wants to see shopping patterns in users**    
    - With this more vague outcome, clustering or some other form of unsupervised learning will be most effective.
- **You want to reduce the number of variables inputting into your random forest model**
    - PCA, lasso regression, or some form of unsupervised variable importance measure, should be used to determine what features can be combined or dropped.
