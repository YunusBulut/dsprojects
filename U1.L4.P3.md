# For each of the following scenarios, call out the potential biases in the proposed experiment. Do your best to try to discover not only the bias, but the initial design. There is plenty of room for interpretation here, so make sure to state what assumptions you're making. 

* **You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.**  
You've taken one sample from a winter month and one from a spring month. Attitudes towards bathing suits, a summer activity, are likely to differ regardless of the email sent, simply because the time until summer clothes are an option is different. This is a bias in assignment to conditions.

* **You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.**  
Your sample is "people who visit a clinic to treat anxiety", and is not representative of the general population. This is a selection bias.

* **You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.**  
I'm assuming that the billboard refers to the website or directs people there somehow, and that a sample was taken prior to the billboard launch that is being compared against (control group). If so, one bias could be timing or seasonality. One week is not a large group and if it coincides with anything else that drives people to spend more time online (change of weather, holidays, etc), it could be that your billboard isn't deserving credit for the new visitors.

* **You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.**  
I'm assuming the initial design was a measure of visits before the loyalty program and after. What's unclear is whether repeat visits are measured. It could be that something about your loyalty program is decreasing the likelihood of casual visitors, and that's offsetting the successfully encouraged visits of loyal customers. Seasonality is also a concern when measuring across weeks. Finally, you may not know the sales cycle yet - perhaps your program is effective but it just takes a couple weeks for your customers to respond and visit.
