# For one of those experiments, write up the essential points of a research proposal for an improved version of that experiment.

***Improved version:***  

**The Problem:**  
We cannot give students in a class all the same test, because they may cheat. However, we must ensure that all students are graded fairly and equally. 

**Hypothesis**   
By creating multiple versions of the test with different answers, we can eliminate cheating opportunities, and by comparing the results over a meaningful sample, we can ensure that the 3 differents tests are equally hard and fair.

**Method**  
The teacher will write three versions of a test. She will ***shuffle*** the three versions together thoroughly. As students arrive for the exam, each student takes a test from the randomized pile. The teacher repeats this for multiple classes/semesters until she has a meaningful sample, and then compares the student scores for each test at the class level. If one test scores differently than the others across multiple classes, we will know it is different enough to merit revisions or perhaps be discarded.
