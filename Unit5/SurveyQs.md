# For each of the following, indicate the best question type to use and why.

- Age: Preferrably a multiple choice dropdown with integers 18-100+. Alternatively  a multiple choice with age brackets. 
- Income: Multiple Choice Brackets (choose one); this is best to encourage responsiveness (given that this is a personal question), and because no one really  gives W-2 exact figures even if given the choice.   
- Opinions about dish soap: Multiple Likert Scales covering various attributes, with a final free-form write-in option
- Brand of dish soap used: Multiple choice (choose multiple) with an 'other' write in option
- Preference for dish soap brand (Cleany, Sudsy, DeGreaser, Pinesoft): Rank them all 1-N
- Positive vs negative feelings about dish soap: Likert Scale

# DRILL: Fix the flaw
Here is a [link](https://action.donaldjtrump.com/mainstream-media-accountability-survey/) to a Mainstream Media Accountability Survey sent to the public by the Trump Administration in February 2017. Read over the survey and select five questions you believe can be improved. Describe the flaw you see and write an improved version of the question.

If they choose the second option:   
b): Which is most accurate with regard to media sensationalism and exaggeration?
- They are most often unfavorable to conservatives
- They are most often unfavorable to liberals
- They are most often unfavorable to other minority political groups
- They are equally unfavorable to everyone

15. Based on your answers above, do you believe that the Republican Party should spend more time and resources holding the mainstream media accountable?

Better written as:
a) Should there be government-sanctioned consequences for private media companies reporting mistruths as truths?
- yes/no

if yes:
b) What would be appropriate consequences?
(write in)
