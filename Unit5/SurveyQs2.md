# DRILL: When to use surveys State whether a survey would be the best option for answering each of the following questions.

- Popularity of various Uber drivers. 
    - A survey would work (as it does in real life), but be mindful that the extremes will be more likely to respond.
- A grocery store wants to know how much people like strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream. 
    - No - analyze shopping habits rather than using surveys
- Recently, rental rates for HappyCars have increased by 30%, which is quite unusual. You want to find out why this is happening and how to keep the increase going. 
    - Yes - a survey in this case would be a good idea. 
- Assessing the success rate of a new advertising campaign.
    - Surveying "how did you hear about us" is fine to do, but a successful ad campaign will be evident in sales numbers, sales activity, or other less subjective metrics.
- Measuring the effect of nurse/patient ratio on patient recovery rates in hospital wards.
    - An A/B experiment would make much more sense than a survey in this case.
