You now have a fairly substantial starting toolbox of supervised learning methods that you can use to tackle a host of exciting problems. To make sure all of these ideas are organized in your mind, please go through the list of problems below. For each, identify which supervised learning method(s) would be best for addressing that particular problem. Explain your reasoning and discuss your answers with your mentor.

- Predict the running times of prospective Olympic sprinters using data from the last 20 Olympics. 
    - Linear Regression: continuous target and a limited range of possibilities
- You have more features (columns) than rows in your dataset.   
    - linear regression won't work, so use PCA to reduce dimensionality if regression makes sense otherwise.
- Identify the most important characteristic predicting likelihood of being jailed before age 20.    
    - A decision tree would split the first node on the most important 
    - p value from a statsmodels logistic regression could also indicate the imporance of different variables
- Implement a filter to “highlight” emails that might be important to the recipient 
    - Naive Bayes
- You have 1000+ features.    
    - Use Lasso (regression) or Random Forest (classification) to see which are most useful, and then from there try other models with just those features.
- Predict whether someone who adds items to their cart on a website will purchase the items.    
    - Naive Bayes, possibly clustering such as KNN
- Your dataset dimensions are 982400 x 500    
    - PCA could help reduce, but may be too slow. Lasso or gradient boosting done on a sample could show the most important attributes
- Identify faces in an image.    
    - Neural Networks is best for this, which could be described as layers of logistic regression with the pixels as inputs.
- Predict which of three flavors of ice cream will be most popular with boys vs girls.
    - A simple Bayesian Probability model may do well here.
