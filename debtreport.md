When I married my wife, we started our marriage off with over 50K in debt. Based on various statistics I’ve heard over the years, our debt levels were pretty typical for college graduates. We’ve been fortunate – steady employment and extended, tough sacrifices over the years enabled us to pay it off and enter a debt-free life, but we know that isn’t typical of people in their 20s. 
This formative experience motivated me to pick up the College Scorecard Dataset from the US Department of Education and see what I can learn about student debt – where it comes from and who’s most likely to graduate with a lot of it.

**Data Description:**

Each line on the college scorecard represents a branch of a higher education institution. Those branches that mutually are part of a single institution (for example, a main campus and its commuter branches) have a UNITID in common, but are rated separately on the scorecard. 
Hundreds of columns then follow describing various performance metrics specific to higher education. These data come from a mix of sources: federal reporting form the institutions, federal financial aid data, and tax information. The data does not claim to comprehensively include private loans that may happen outside the federal financial aid process, although in the cases where data come from tax information, it may be that some of those loans are included.
