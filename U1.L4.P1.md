# For each of the following questions, outline how you could use an A/B test to find an answer. Be sure to identify all five key components of an A/B test we outlined above.

* **Does a new supplement help people sleep better?**  

Select a sample at random from the general population, ensure that they are similar samples and randomly split. One will get the sample and the other will get no sample. The hypothesis would be that the supplement helps people sleep longer, or perhaps feel more refreshed after sleep. The key metric is worth discussing: one opinion could be hours slept and could be monitored with technology. This option is objectively measurable. Another option is a daily record of how refreshed they feel upon waking - at a minimum this should be recorded as secondary variables measured. Other measurable variables should be related to other effects, such as daytime energy felt, hydration, and diet.

* **Will new uniforms help a gym's business?**  

2 random samples will be hard to get as this is an all-on-all-off environment in a seasonal business. One way to try this might be to alternate days where staff wears the new vs. old uniforms and see if you find an increase in sales with the new uniform. Ensure that it's a truely random split of days: neither uniform can get a larger share of weekends, or more outgoing/attractive staff members, over the course of the study. I'd recommend doing this for a couple months at least, to make sure that you have enough days in each uniform to be meaningful and eliminate other noise. Other measured variables could be sign-ins per day to give some indication of volume for each day the uniforms were worn.

* **Will a new homepage improve my online exotic pet rental business?**   

Design a new front page, and each time a Unique IP address visits your site, they should be randomly given either the new or the old site on a random basis. The separation should truly be random, ensuring that different IP regions are not biased toward one of the options. The hypothesis should be that visitors who receive the new site make more purchases. Click throughs, pages visited, and time spent on the site should also be measured. 

* **If I put 'please read' in the email subject will more people read my emails?**  

Separate your list at random into one list that will receive the 'please read' note in the subject, and one that won't. The hypothesis should be that your test group will open your email more often than the control group. Others measured variables to track should be time spent with the email open, as well as click through rates, and what they do with the email after reading (save, delete, spam, unsubscribe?).
