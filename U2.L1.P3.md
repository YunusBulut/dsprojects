# Categorize each of the following research questions as "good" or "bad", and provide alternative formulations for the bad ones. Save your responses in a document of some kind, submit a link below, and discuss your reasoning with your mentor.

**What is the 1994 rate of juvenile delinquency in the U.S.?**  
Bad: This is a poor research question because that is most likely already a documented statistic that can simply be found through other sources. A better research question would be to try to predict a future year's rate.

**What can we do to reduce juvenile delinquency in the U.S.?**  
Bad: This is too vague a question to answer using quantities or probabilities; a better research question would be to propose a specific solution and then test/research whether it was truely reducing juvenile delinquency or not.

**Does education play a role in reducing juvenile delinquents' return to crime?**  
Good assuming there exists a way to collect data on this.

**How many customers does AT&T currently serve in Washington, DC?**  
Good, assuming it isn't already reported at the city level. Research on marketshare and demographic assumptions could be made to estimate this.

**What factors lead consumers to choose AT&T over other service providers?**  
Good

**How can AT&T attract more customers?**  
Bad, Too vague: propose a more specific solution too test. "Can a 3 month discount help AT&T attract more customers?"

**Why did the Challenger Shuttle explode?**  
Bad given that this is largely documented and explained. "Do aircraft made by Rockwell's space division fail more often than other  institutions?"

**Which genes are associated with increased risk of breast cancer?**  
Good, assuming you have enough time to learn all the biological knowledge required to test and process the results.

**Is it better to read to children at night or in the morning?**  
BAD: Too vague - need to define "better". "Does reading to children at night vs in the morning change their reading comprehension?"

**How does Googleâ€™s search algorithm work?**  
Bad: Too vague and can't be quantified. "Which parts of the web page are best to edit in order to increase your Google search rankings?"
