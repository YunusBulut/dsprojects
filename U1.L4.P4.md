# Now it's time to flex your critical evaluation skills. Read the following descriptions of an experiment and its analysis, identify the flaws in each, and describe what you would do to correct them.

* **The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger," isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy." They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the "Anger" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the "Together" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that "Anger" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.**  
We must assume that the conversion of droids (as opposed to other Star Wars demographics) is the main goal, if not that's a glaring issue with this experiment. However, the main problem with this experiment design and analysis was that it ignored the message deliverer. It could be that Emperor Palpatine is simply a more effective recruiter of drones, for any number of reasons. The slogan is not necessarily to blame. I'd recommend holding the recruiter constant for the experiment, or perhaps even testing all possible combinations of recruiter & slogan separately.

* **In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.**  
I would encourage the Jedi to look at not only the overall success rate, but also the success rate at the planetary level. Jar Jar was sent to 4 friendly planets while Mace was sent to unfriendly planets, so it's very possible that Mace was more influential but simply applied his influence to a less responsive sample. Additionally, planetary size should be considered, not just a % of changes; per the Simpson's paradox, simply looking at the total % of changes without considering sub groups can led to inaccurate conclusions.

* **A company with work sites in five different countries has sent you data on employee satisfaction rates for workers in Human Resources and workers in Information Technology. Most HR workers are concentrated in three of the countries, while IT workers are equally distributed across worksites. The company requests a report on satisfaction for each job type. You calculate average job satisfaction for HR and for IT and present the report.**  
Where you live can influence your job satisfaction. It make more sense to compare the departments at the location level for the 3 areas where IT has a footprint, so you can eliminate any noise related to where the workers live. 

* **When people install the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app, they are asked to "opt in" to a data collection scheme where their level of physical activity data is automatically sent to the company for product research purposes. During your interview with the company, they tell you that the app is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise steadily.**  
Hawthorne effect: people act differently when they know they are observed. It's unclear from this claim whether the app itself is increasing activity levels, or if the act of observations is causing people to increase their activity levels, perhaps even temporarily. Additionally, finding 2 truly random samples would be important in testing this claim. For example, I could argue that people who download the app voluntarily are likely on a self-improvement path anyway, and might have had increased activity levels without the app as well.

* **To prevent cheating, a teacher writes three versions of a test. She stacks the three versions together, first all copies of Version A, then all copies of Version B, then all copies of Version C. As students arrive for the exam, each student takes a test. When grading the test, the teacher finds that students who took Version B scored higher than students who took either Version A or Version C. She concludes from this that Version B is easier, and discards it.**  
Because the teacher did not distribute the tests randomly, she cannot be sure that the B-test students scored higher BECAUSE of the B test. Perhaps students who arrive very early or very late are less confident or less prepared, and therefore could test worse regardless of the test. Additionally, if a group of cheaters came in together, they'd all get the same test (potentially B in this example) and could still cheat and skew the results from test B. She would be best served to randomize the pile of tests and try the experiment again.
